            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>1. Charges</h2>
          <p>
            Charges for the Services are set in the quotation that the Client
            receives from Rachel Lawson. Quotations are valid for a period of 30
            days. Rachel Lawson reserves the right to alter a quotation or
            decline to provide the relevant Services after expiry of the 30
            days.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project and payment plan must be discussed in a consultation
            meeting before a Client receives a quotation from Rachel Lawson.
            Quotations will either have an hourly rate or a fixed rate. Rachel
            Lawson has the right to choose the type of rate offered to the
            Client for their project. The quotation will specify if payments are
            to be made on a weekly basis or by pre-determined project
            milestones.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Client is expected to follow the payment agreement from the
            quotation throughout the duration of the project. By signing the
            quotation the Client agrees to full responsibility of fulfilling the
            payments for the Service. The Client must provide Rachel Lawson with
            a minimum 24 hours notice from the set payment date before
            requesting to change their payment plan. Both the Client and Rachel
            Lawson have the right to terminate the agreement at any time. All
            payments outlined in the quotation due to be paid up until the date
            of termination must be paid by the Client in full. In the event the
            Service is terminated by either Rachel Lawson or the Client, the
            Client agrees to pay all remaining Charges up to the date of
            termination following the terms above regardless of the payment
            plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Client agrees to reimburse Rachel Lawson for any third-party
            expenses necessary for the completion of the work that have been
            discussed and agreed upon by the Client and Rachel Lawson. Expenses
            may include (but are not limited to) purchase of stock images,
            special fonts, and graphic designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Client agrees to purchase all subscriptions necessary for the
            Service. Subscriptions may include (but are not limited to) domain
            names, shared hosting plans, and all taxes/fees associated with
            third-party products. Subscriptions must be made by the Client.
            Rachel Lawson will not provide paid third-party subscription
            services related to the Service and can only assist the Client by
            providing instructions, guidance, and suggestions. The Client must
            give Rachel Lawson access to the subscriptions they purchase as
            needed for the Service to be completed.
          </p>
          <p>All Charges are exclusive of tax/vat.</p>
          <h2>2. Invoicing and Payment</h2>
          <p>
            Rachel Lawson shall submit invoices in line with the payment plan
            outlined in the quotation signed by the Client. Invoices are
            normally sent by email, but hard copy invoices are available on
            request. Payment is due on receipt of the invoice by the Client.
          </p>
          <p>
            Payment for services are due by Check or PayPal. Checks should be
            made payable to Rachel Lawson and sent to Rachel Lawson with the
            address and bank details stated on the invoice.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the Client fails to make any payment due to Rachel Lawson by the
            due date for payment, then, without limiting Rachel Lawson's
            remedies under or in connection with these Terms of Service, the
            Client shall pay a fee of $50.00 for each week the payment is
            overdue. Such interest shall accrue on a weekly basis from the due
            date stated on the invoice until actual payment of the overdue
            amount is made by the Client. The Client shall pay the fee together
            with the overdue amount. In the event Rachel Lawson or the Client
            terminates the Service while payments are overdue, the Client is
            responsible for fulfilling the payments within (30) days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accounts unpaid thirty (30) days after the date of invoice will be
            considered in default. If the Client in default maintains any
            information or files on Rachel Lawson's Devices, Rachel Lawson, at
            their discretion, remove all such material from its web space.
            Rachel Lawson is not responsible for any loss of data incurred due
            to the removal of the service. Removal of such material does not
            relieve the Client of the obligation to pay any outstanding charges
            assessed to the Client's account. Payments returned for insufficient
            funds will be assessed a return charge of $25 and the Client's
            account will immediately be considered to be in default until full
            payment is received. Clients with accounts in default agree to pay
            Rachel Lawson reasonable expenses, including legal fees and costs
            for collection by third-party agencies, incurred by Rachel Lawson in
            enforcing these Terms.
          </p>
          <h2>3. Project Proposal Agreement</h2>
          <p>
            Upon acceptance of the quotation provided to the Client by Rachel
            Lawson, Rachel Lawson will prepare a project proposal agreement
            which outlines 1. information and details discussed in the
            consultation meeting, 2. the estimated timeframe of the project, 3.
            the cooperation required from the Client (including but not limited
            to providing website content, reviewing the website design, and
            upholding reasonably consistent communication), 4. a step-by-step
            outline of the plan for project completion, and 5. a copy of these
            Terms of Service. The Client must sign the agreement and the
            quotation before work on the project will officially begin.
          </p>
          <h2>4. Refunds</h2>
          <p>
            Web design and development projects require extensive resources and
            time. Therefore once a payment or deposit is made, it is
            non-refundable. If a project gets terminated, delayed or postponed
            by the Client, then all funds paid will be retained by Rachel
            Lawson, and if applicable, an additional cost will be charged to the
            Client for all work completed beyond what was already paid for shall
            be paid by the Client. All projects that are completed as defined as
            the scope of the work are non-refundable.
          </p>
          <h2>5. Client Review</h2>
          <p>
            Rachel Lawson will provide the Client with opportunities to review
            the appearance and content of the project throughout the design
            phase and once development is complete. At the time of each review,
            the Client may request changes to be made. If the changes requested
            by the Client are deemed by Rachel Lawson to go unreasonably beyond
            the scope of the project outlined in the agreement, Rachel Lawson
            has the right to change the agreement, quotation, and payment plan.
            At the completion of the project, such materials will be deemed to
            be accepted and approved unless the Client notifies Rachel Lawson
            otherwise within ten (10) days of the date the materials are made
            available to the Client. After the 10 day period the Service
            quotation and agreement will no longer be valid, and Rachel Lawson
            is not responsible or obligated to provide further Service to the
            Client.
          </p>
          <h2>6. Project Timeline and Content</h2>
          <p>
            Rachel Lawson will provide the Client's materials by the date
            specified in the project proposal agreement, or at the date agreed
            with Client upon Rachel Lawson receiving initial payment, unless a
            delay is specifically stated in writing by the Client or Rachel
            Lawson.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Client agrees to provide Rachel Lawson promptly with all
            necessary materials including (but not limited to) logos, written
            content, media content, design preferences, data, relevant
            information, and timely decision-making which may be reasonably
            required by Rachel Lawson for the performance of the Services. The
            Client will receive a list of necessary materials from Rachel Lawson
            which are required to complete the project. In the event the Client
            does not provide the necessary materials within a reasonable amount
            of time in such a way that Rachel Lawson believes the completion
            date will be impacted, Rachel Lawson has the right to specify a new
            completion date.
          </p>
          <h2>7. Web Browsers and Screen Sizes</h2>
          <p>
            Rachel Lawson makes every effort to ensure websites are designed to
            be viewed by the majority of visitors on a variety of devices.
            Websites are designed to work with the most popular current browsers
            (e.g. Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge etc.). The Client
            agrees that Rachel Lawson cannot guarantee correct functionality
            with all browser software across different operating systems, or
            that the website will look satisfactory on less common device screen
            sizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rachel Lawson cannot accept responsibility for web pages which do
            not display acceptably in new versions of browsers released after
            the website has been designed and handed over to the Client. As
            such, Rachel Lawson reserves the right to charge for any work
            involved in changing the website design or website code for it to
            work with updated browser software or uncommon screen sizes.
          </p>
          <h2>8. Termination</h2>
          <p>
            Termination of services by the Client must be requested in a written
            notice and will be effective on receipt of such notice. The Client
            will be invoiced for work completed (including any expenses
            incurred, as outlined in clause 1) to the date of first notice of
            cancellation for payment in full (as outlined in clause 1) within
            thirty (30) days. The Client is not obligated to refunds of any kind
            even if the project is terminated by Rachel Lawson.
          </p>
          <h2>9. Indemnity</h2>
          <p>
            All Rachel Lawson's services must be used for lawful purposes only.
            The Client agrees to indemnify and hold Rachel Lawson harmless
            against all damages, losses and expenses arising as a result of any
            and all actions or claims resulting from the Client's use of Rachel
            Lawson's Service.
          </p>

            used in connection with these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Foreground IP means any IP Rights that arise or are obtained or
            developed by, or by a contractor on behalf of, either party in
            respect of the services and deliverables under or in connection with
            these Terms.
          </p>

            renewals or extensions of, and rights to claim priority from, such
            rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection
            which subsist or will subsist now or in the future in any part of
            the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            All Background IP, including but not limited to any IP Rights in
            data, files and graphic logos provided to Rachel Lawson by the
            Client, is and shall remain the exclusive property of the party
            owning it (or, where applicable, the third party from whom its right
            to use the Background IP has derived).
          </p>

            contractor acting on behalf of Rachel Lawson. The Client must obtain
            permission and rights to use any information or files that are

            granting Rachel Lawson permission and rights for use of the same. A

            and authorities have been obtained. Evidence of permissions and
            authorities may be requested. The Client shall indemnify and hold

          <p>
            All Foreground IP shall vest in and be owned absolutely by the party
            creating or developing it. Rachel Lawson hereby grants the Client a
            non-exclusive license of such Foreground IP for the purpose of
            operating the website.
          </p>
          <h2>11. Credit and Marketing</h2>
          <p>
            A link to Rachel Lawson will appear in either small type or by a
            small graphic at the bottom of the Client's website. If a graphic is
            used, it will be designed to fit in with the overall site design. If
            a Client requests that the design credit be removed, a nominal fee
            of 5% of the total development charges will be applied. When total
            development charges are less than $2,000, a fixed fee of $100 will
            be applied.

          <p>
            The Client agrees that the website developed for the Client may be
            presented in Rachel Lawson's portfolio, and hereby grants Rachel
            Lawson a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive license to use its
            name, logo and branding for advertising, marketing and promotional
            activities.

          <h2>12. Third Party Servers</h2>
          <p>
            Rachel Lawson designs and tests websites to work on the agreed-upon
            shared-hosting server, and cannot guarantee correct functionality if
            the Client wishes to use a different server later on. In the event
            that the Client is using a third-party server, it is the
            responsibility of the Client and any third party host to ensure that
            the server is compatible with the website.
          </p>
          <h2>13. Post-Placement Alterations</h2>
          <p>
            Rachel Lawson cannot accept responsibility for any alterations
            caused by the Client or a third party occurring to the website once
            the project is completed. Such alterations include, but are not
            limited to additions, modifications or deletions.
          </p>
          <h2>14. Third Party Products</h2>

            standard terms. The one-off license fee for such third party
            materials is included in the Charges payable pursuant to clause 3.
          </p>
          <h2>15. Liability</h2>
          <p>
            Nothing in these Terms shall operate to exclude or limit either
            party's liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by its
            negligence; (b) fraud; or (c) any other liability which cannot be
            excluded or limited under applicable law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rachel Lawson shall not be liable under or in connection with these
            Terms or any collateral contract for any: (a) loss of revenue; (b)
            loss of actual or anticipated profits; (c) loss of contracts; (d)
            loss of business; (e) loss of opportunity; (f) loss of goodwill or
            reputation; (g) loss of, damage to or corruption of data; (h) any
            indirect or consequential loss; (i) loss or damage caused by any
            inaccuracy, omission, delay or error, whether as a result of
            negligence or other cause in the production of the website; or (j)
            loss or damage to the Client's artwork/photos supplied for the
            website, whether as a result of negligence or otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            The entire liability of Rachel Lawson to the Client in respect of
            any claim whatsoever or breach of this Agreement, whether or not
            arising out of negligence, shall be limited to the Charges paid for
            the Services under this Agreement in respect of which the breach has
            arisen.
          </p>
          <h2>16. Severability</h2>
          <p>
            In the event any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement
            shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining
            provisions of this Agreement shall be unimpaired and the Agreement
            shall not be void for this reason alone. Such invalid, illegal or
            unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a mutually acceptable
            valid, legal and enforceable provision, which comes closest to the
            intention of the parties underlying the original provision.
          </p>
          <h2>17. "As Is" and "As Available" Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>
            The Service is provided to You "As Is" and "As Available" and with
            all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum
            extent permitted under applicable law, Rachel Lawson expressly
            disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or
            otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied
            warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
            title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of
            course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice.
            Without limitation to the foregoing, Rachel Lawson provides no
            warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind
            that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended
            results, be compatible or work with any other software,
            applications, systems or services, operate without interruption,
            meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or
            that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without limiting the foregoing, Rachel Lawson has no representation
            or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation
            or availability of the Service, or the information, content, and
            materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will
            be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy,
            reliability, or currency of any information or content provided
            through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the
            content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of Rachel Lawson are free

            other harmful components.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
            warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
            consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
            not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
            set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
            enforceable under applicable law.
          </p>

          <p>
            A failure or delay by a party to exercise any right or remedy
            provided under this agreement or by law shall not constitute a

            restrict any further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.
          </p>
